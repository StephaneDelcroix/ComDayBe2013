      <t>Windows Azure Web Sites – things they don’t teach kids in school</t>
      <o>Microsoft has a cloud platform which runs .NET, NodeJS and PHP. All 101 talks out there will show you the same: it’s easy to deploy, it scales out on demand and it runs WordPress. Great! But what about doing real things? In this session, we’ll explore the things they don’t teach kids in school. We’ll cover the different deployment options for Windows Azure Web Sites, the development flow, awesome things you can do with the command line tools, modifying the automated build process and explore some lesser known techniques of this platform. </o>

      <t>Building real-time applications with SignalR and Windows Phone 8</t>
      <o>Building an application that can communicate to a server or to other applications in real-time can be a time consuming, and very difficult task. If only there was a library that would take care of all the boilerplate code and let us do the fun stuff. That’s where SignalR comes in, an open source library developed by Microsoft that allows us to focus on the fun side. Join Nico Vermeir, a passionate mobile developer, in a session that walks you through setting up a basic SignalR service and letting your Windows Phone 8 app talk to it.

      <t>Data Visualization Tips &amp; Tricks</t>
      <o>You need to build a couple of reports showing vital data to business users and management is already breathing down your neck. How can you develop compelling reports that draw the reader’s attention without obfuscating the critical numbers? With Reporting Services, Microsoft's corporate reporting solution, you can build rich and powerful reports. This session will introduce you to some key concepts about data visualization, which you can use to build engaging and convincing reports. You will also learn a few tricks to create a more complex reporting experience, such as multi-column reports and consistent dynamic color usage.

      <t>Your Data in 3D</t>
      <o>Ever imagined what your data would look like if presented in 3D? This session will show you which common issues you encounter when only dealing with flat data and how three dimensional representations will simplify some of the business requirements and tackle those issues. In this little presentation you will see your SQL Server data coming to life in a WPF presentation powered by 3D. </o>

      <t>The social developer</t>
      <o>This presentation centers on people, teams and how to combine both into a creative, fun and efficient combination of excellence. It's about investing in yourself as a person. It's about not being afraid of change, of speaking up, of trying to excel, of being passionate. It's about creative teams, about how to build and coach them. It's about choices you'll have to make in your personal and professional career. It's about finding back the flow in your work and life. It's about finding back the wonder that you had as a little child. </o>

      <t>Object Calisthenics; Practices for Writing Object-Oriented C#</t>
      <o>According to Wikipedia, Calisthenics are a form of exercise consisting of a variety of simple, often rhythmical, movements, generally without using equipment or apparatus. Since programming without Visual Studio is going to be a bit challenging you can define Object Calisthenics as a programming exercise that uses simple rules to motivate you to take an object-oriented approach to programming. As an experienced developer practicing Test Driven Development I was a bit sceptical of whether I really needed those rules to be a better programmer. But to my surprise those little rules really reinforced my beliefs about building high-quality software using the principles of object-orientation, SOLID and Clean Code. So what are those rules? I won’t tell you…yet. Just come to my session and I’ll let you in on my secrets…</o>

    <t>Emancipate your C# – Introduction to Xamarin 2.0</t>
    <o>
      Xamarin allows you to easily write mobile apps for iOS &amp; Android in your favourite language: C#. Because who wants to code in Objective-C or Java anyway? And we all know the truth about those “native” HTML5 / Javascript mobile apps, right? In this session, we’ll see how Xamarin can speed up your mobile developments by sharing a major part of your codebase while deploying fully native applications to multiple platforms. You’d never thought your C# could leave Redmond for a road trip.

      <t>NuGet (Anti-) Patterns – Tales from the trenches</t>
      <o>Many organizations trying to onboard NuGet are expecting to experience a fast transition from dependency hell towards a structured and organized NuGet package repository. Whilst some succeed with ease, others don't know where to start and fail miserably. This session aims to raise awareness around some NuGet (anti-)patterns and practices. Whether you're working on open source projects or in an enterprise environment, or both, this session might help you saving some time and headaches regarding package creation, versioning and publication, as well as repository organization and automated builds. </o>

      <t>Windows 8 Store Apps – From Turtle to Rabbit</t>
      <o>One of the most important aspects of a Windows Store application is its performance: an end-user will simply not keep on using your app if (s)he has to wait too long to complete the task (s)he’s using it for – after all, for most apps, there will be loads of alternatives. In this session, you’ll learn about what you can do to keep your Windows Store application as performant as possible. We’ll dive into some of the available tools for this, we’ll look into the XAML parsing engine, and we’ll learn about resource dictionary strategies to ensure fast loading of your application. But we won’t stop there: you’ll also learn how to perform tasks in parallel, how to offload tasks that don’t belong on your UI thread to another thread, how to incrementally load data instead of loading it all at once, … This is a session that’ll dive into a lot of performance aspects of a Windows Store app – a must if you’re serious about developing the next killer app for Windows 8! </o>

      <t>Data-driven Subscription using SSIS and SharePoint</t>
      <o>SQL Server Reporting Services provides data-driven subscriptions to render reports based on information in a database table. This is a very nice feature but the down side is that you are required to purchase an Enterprise license (or BI license in SQL 2012) of SQL Server in order to use this feature. Customers like this feature but don't want to pay for the Enterprise license so I searched for an alternative with standard licenses. In this session I will show the alternative where the end user can still create his own subscription in SharePoint. Step-by-step I will create an SQL Server Integration Services package that renders reports to a SharePoint library on values stored in the database. </o>
